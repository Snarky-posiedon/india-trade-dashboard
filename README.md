India Trade Flow Dashboard: Import-Export Trends
Project Overview
This project analyzes India's monthly import and export values across various commodity sectors to identify trade imbalances, highlight top trading categories, and uncover seasonal patterns. The insights generated are valuable for policymakers, trade analysts, and business strategists looking to understand India's trade dynamics.
Objective
Analyze India's trade data to:
Identify trade imbalances by commodity sector
Highlight top performing trading categories
Detect seasonal patterns in import/export flows
Provide actionable insights for trade policy and business decisions
Tools & Technologies
SQL (SQLite/PostgreSQL) - Data querying and aggregation
Tableau/Power BI - Interactive dashboard creation
Microsoft Excel - Summarization and sensitivity analysis
Python (pandas) - ETL processes and data transformations
Data Source
Dataset: "India – Trade Data" from Kaggle
 Contains monthly import/export values by commodity sectors for India.
Setup Instructions
1. Data Preparation
Data Cleaning Process:
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3

# Load and inspect data
df = pd.read_csv('india_trade_data.csv')

# Data cleaning steps
df['month'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Month'], format='%Y-%m')

# Handle missing values and normalize commodity names
df = df.dropna(subset=['Import_USM', 'Export_USM'])
df['Commodity'] = df['Commodity'].str.strip().str.title()

# Create database connection and staging table
conn = sqlite3.connect('trade_analysis.db')
df.to_sql('trade', conn, if_exists='replace', index=False)

2. SQL Analysis
Key SQL query for aggregated analysis:
SELECT 
    strftime('%Y', month) AS year,
    Commodity,
    SUM(Import_USM) AS total_import,
    SUM(Export_USM) AS total_export,
    (SUM(Export_USM) - SUM(Import_USM)) AS trade_balance
FROM trade 
GROUP BY year, Commodity 
ORDER BY year, total_export DESC;

3. Dashboard Development
